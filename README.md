# Portfolio
## Profile
I am passionate about data and the methods one can use to employ meaningful decision making. 

I have completed my Bachelor Degree in Business Science, which has given me the foundation of understanding how companies report on their financial data in accordance with the IFRS and IAS reporting standards. I strive to utilize my foundational knowledge of accounting and pair it with my newly aquired skills of implementing machine learning models, to better add value to a boards strategic decision making abilities.

I believe Data is more than just numbers housed in a warehouse. Data helps define trends and aid a company to make certain decisions that revolve around those trends. 

I aim to add value to my employer through a team driven process whereby we perform efficient actions that have been built upon various data science techniques and critical analysis.

## Personal Projects
#### Classification of the MNIST Dataset
The objective of this task was to utilize multiple machine learning models to correctly identify and classify numbers through images.

The project contains a quick exploration of the data to ascertain the distribution of each number. I then proceed with selecting 2 different machine learning models to discover which model would be best in correctly Identifying new data.

#### Classifying Book Reviews using Recurrent Neural Networks
The project uses 6 recurrent neaural networks, sharing the same architecture, in order to determine which models hyperparameters are best. The main objective for this project was to classify whether a review was positive or negative using NLP.
